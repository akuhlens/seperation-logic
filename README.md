# Verified Data Structures

This repository serves as a learning ground for using separation logic
with low level programming languages.  I don't really know much about
it so here is my current game plan. This will likely changes as I
learn more.

For anything that is a _Software Foundations_ book I will leave out
solutions to the exercises at the authors requests.

## Plan

- [ ] read [preface.v](dsss18/vc/Preface.v) and follow preperation suggestions
  - [X] You will also need a working knowledge of the C programming
     language.
  - [X] Study  _Software Foundations Volume 1_  (Logical Foundations)
  - [ ] Study the Hoare and Hoare2 chapters of _Software Foundations
    Volume 2_ (Programming Language Foundations), and do the exercises!
  - [ ] Study the Sort, SearchTree, and ADT chapters of _Software
    Foundations Volume 3_ (Verified Functional Algorithms), and do the
    exercises! 
- [ ] install vst tool chain 
- [ ] Complete the _Software Foundation Volume 4_
