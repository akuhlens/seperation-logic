# Verified Data Structures

This repository serves as a learning ground for using separation logic
with low level programming languages.  I don't really know much about
it so here is my current game plan. This will likely changes as I
learn more.

## Plan

- [ ] [Initialize VST 2.2 submodule which I plan to build against](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST)
- [ ] [Do the deepspec summer school VST toolchain projects.](https://github.com/DeepSpec/dsss18/tree/master/vc)
